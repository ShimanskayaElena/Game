# Game

Test. It was necessary to write a script that simulates the take-off of aircraft in the order established by the user himself. Take-off of the aircraft must be carried out within 10 seconds, while no other aircraft at this time can be on the runway. All this should happen in real time.

To automatically reboot the browser while saving the file, BrowserSync was set up together with Gulp.4

To start the project (game), you need to run the gulp command in the terminal.
